"""Build the per-group KV-cache addressing plans for connector v2.

One entry point, :func:`build_group_layouts`: walk every KV group of the
parsed spec and hand the runtime views to :class:`KVCacheGroupLayout`,
which flattens them into addressing columns.  Declarations (0.29)
already ride the layer specs -- ``UCMLayerSpec.descriptor`` -- after
``parse_kv_cache_config`` mirrored them; 0.26 layers carry None and the
groups build the same way.
